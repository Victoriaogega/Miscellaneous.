# Miscellaneous.
I created a repository called Miscellaneous. From there i created a branch called feature/safety-training. Inside the branch,  added a file called Victoria_safety_guidelines.pdf which includes safety guidelines which are supposed to be observed by students while on campus.
I then pushed all the information to git-hub.
