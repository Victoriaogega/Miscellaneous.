# Miscellaneous.
I created a repository called Miscellaneous. 
From there i created a branch feature/safety-training. 
Inside the branch, i added a file called Victoria_safety_guidelines which is about safety guidelines which are supposed to be observed by students while on campus.
I then pushed all the information to git-hub.
